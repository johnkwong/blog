#### Graph
A grah is a collection of points (vertices, nodes) and line (edges, arcs) connectiong some subset of them. G(V,E)

#### Methods to store a graph
1. Adjacency Matrix: a square matrix - Matrix[i][j] = 1 , Matrix[i][j] = 0
2. Adjacency List: a collection of unordered list - Vector or List to store adjacency list

#### Directed and Undirected Graph
Directed = Unidirectional : <-- or -->  
Undirected = Bidirectional : <--->

#### Weighted and Unweighted Graph
Weighted Graph: a graph in which a number is assigned to each edge  
Unweighted Graph: the weight of all edges are same (presumably 1)

#### Path
Path: a way of going from one to another.

#### Degree
Degree: degree of vertex is number of edgeds that are connected to it.
1. In-degree: the number of edgeds that point to the node
2. Out-degree: the number of edgeds the point from the node to other nodes
